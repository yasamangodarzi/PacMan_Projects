Artificial Intelligence, Pacman Game
======================================

## Intro
[The Pacman Projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) by the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu/).

> In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. Try to build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

Start a game by the command:
```
$ python pacman.py
```
You can see the list of all options and their default values via:
```
$ python pacman.py -h
```

## Search
Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms.

##  Multi-Agent
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

## Reinforcement Learning
Implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.
